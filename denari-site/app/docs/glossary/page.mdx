# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms related to Denari and its ecosystem.

## A

### Algorithmic Supply Adjustment
The automatic process by which Denari's token supply expands or contracts in response to changes in inflation data, ensuring the cryptocurrency maintains its purchasing power over time.

## B

### Basket of Goods and Services
The collection of consumer products and services used to calculate inflation rates. Denari uses a carefully selected basket that represents typical consumer spending patterns across various categories.

## C

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)
A measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services. One of the primary inflation metrics used by Denari's oracles.

### Cross-Chain Compatibility
The ability of Denari to interact with other blockchain networks, allowing for seamless asset transfers and integration with various decentralized applications.

## D

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
A blockchain-based form of finance that offers financial instruments without relying on intermediaries such as banks. Denari serves as a stable foundation for various DeFi applications.

### Denari Index
The proprietary inflation index that Denari uses to track changes in purchasing power, derived from multiple inflation data sources.

## E

### Elastic Supply
A token model where the supply can increase or decrease algorithmically based on predefined conditions. Denari uses an elastic supply mechanism that responds to inflation data.

## G

### Governance
The system by which Denari token holders collectively make decisions about the protocol, including parameter adjustments, feature additions, and treasury management.

## I

### Inflation
The general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing power of money over time. Denari is designed to maintain consistent purchasing power despite inflation.

### Inflation-Indexed
A financial instrument whose value is adjusted according to inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Denari is an inflation-indexed cryptocurrency.

### Inflation Oracle
The decentralized mechanism that brings real-world inflation data onto the blockchain, allowing Denari to adjust its supply in response to changing economic conditions.

## N

### Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)
The consensus mechanism used by Denari, where validators are selected to produce blocks based on their stake and nominations from other token holders.

## P

### Pallet
A module in the Substrate framework that provides specific functionality to the blockchain. Denari uses custom pallets to implement its inflation-indexing features.

### Purchasing Power
The value of a currency in terms of the amount of goods or services that one unit can buy. Preserving purchasing power is Denari's primary objective.

## R

### Rebase
The process of automatically adjusting Denari's token supply based on inflation data, which occurs at regular intervals.

## S

### Seigniorage
The difference between the face value of money and the cost of producing it. In Denari, seigniorage refers to newly created tokens during supply expansions.

### Slashing
A penalty mechanism in Nominated Proof-of-Stake systems where validators lose a portion of their staked tokens for malicious or negligent behavior.

### Staking
The process of locking up Denari tokens to support network operations, earn rewards, and participate in governance.

### Substrate
The blockchain development framework created by Parity Technologies that Denari uses as its foundation. Substrate enables modular blockchain design with upgradeable runtime components.

## T

### Treasury
A pool of Denari tokens managed through governance and used to fund protocol development, community initiatives, and other activities that benefit the ecosystem.

## V

### Validator
A node in the Denari network responsible for validating transactions, producing blocks, and maintaining consensus. Validators stake tokens as collateral to ensure honest behavior.
