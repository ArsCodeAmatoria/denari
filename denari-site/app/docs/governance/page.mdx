# Governance

Denari employs a decentralized governance model that puts the power of decision-making directly in the hands of its community members. This page details how governance works and how you can participate.

## Governance Philosophy

Denari is built on the principle that those who hold the token should have a say in its evolution. Our governance model is designed to be:

- **Transparent**: All proposals and voting happen on-chain with complete visibility
- **Inclusive**: Any token holder can participate in governance
- **Efficient**: Balanced approach between responsiveness and security
- **Resistant to Capture**: Multiple safeguards prevent dominance by any single entity

## Governance Structure

### Council
The Denari Council consists of elected members who help guide the protocol's development:

- **Size**: 7 elected council members
- **Term**: 3-month terms with staggered elections
- **Role**: Council members can fast-track emergency proposals and provide guidance, but they do not have unilateral control

### Technical Committee
A group of technical experts who evaluate and provide feedback on technical proposals:

- **Membership**: Selected based on contributions to the codebase and technical expertise
- **Role**: Advisory only, helping the community understand technical implications of proposals

## Types of Proposals

### Parameter Changes
Changes to system parameters that don't require code changes:

- Inflation index weighting
- Oracle thresholds
- Treasury allocation percentages
- Voting periods and thresholds

### Runtime Upgrades
Proposals to upgrade the protocol's code:

- New features
- Security improvements
- Performance enhancements

### Treasury Proposals
Requests for funding from the Denari treasury:

- Development initiatives
- Marketing and education
- Community events
- Partnership opportunities

## Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Pre-proposal Discussion**: Ideas are first discussed in the forum to gather community feedback
2. **Proposal Creation**: A formal proposal is submitted on-chain with a bond (refundable if passed)
3. **Voting Period**: Token holders cast votes during a predetermined period (usually 7 days)
4. **Execution**: If passed, proposals are automatically executed after an enactment period

## Voting Mechanics

### Conviction Voting
Denari uses a conviction voting system:

- Votes can be locked for longer periods to increase their weight
- Longer lock periods signal stronger conviction and carry more influence
- This system helps prevent vote buying and encourages long-term thinking

### Vote Weight
Your vote weight is determined by:

- Number of tokens held
- Lock period selected (higher conviction = higher weight)
- Delegation received from other token holders

### Delegation
Token holders can delegate their voting power to trusted community members:

- Delegates vote on behalf of those who delegated to them
- Delegation can be revoked at any time
- Helps improve participation rates and expertise in voting

## Treasury Management

The Denari treasury receives funds from:

- A portion of transaction fees
- A small percentage of newly minted tokens
- Donations and grants

These funds are allocated through governance decisions to support projects that benefit the ecosystem.
