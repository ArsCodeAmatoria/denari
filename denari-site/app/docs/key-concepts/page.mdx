# Key Concepts

This page explains the fundamental concepts behind Denari and how it works as an inflation-indexed cryptocurrency.

## Inflation Indexing

At its core, Denari is designed to maintain purchasing power by automatically adjusting its supply based on inflation data:

- **Price Stability**: Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that aim for a fixed supply, Denari's supply adjusts to maintain consistent purchasing power.
- **Inflation Oracle**: Denari uses decentralized oracle networks to bring real-world inflation data on-chain.
- **Algorithmic Supply Adjustment**: Based on oracle data, the protocol automatically issues or burns tokens to maintain purchasing power parity.

## The Inflation Index

Denari tracks a carefully selected basket of goods and services to create a reliable inflation index:

- **Basket Composition**: The index includes essential categories like food, housing, transportation, healthcare, and education.
- **Geographic Weighting**: Initially based on global averages with plans to support regional indices.
- **Update Frequency**: The index is updated on a monthly basis to maintain accuracy while avoiding excessive volatility.

## Tokenomics

Denari's economic design incorporates several key principles:

- **Elastic Supply**: The total supply of Denari expands and contracts based on inflation data.
- **Proportional Adjustments**: When supply adjusts, all holders' balances are affected proportionally.
- **Seigniorage Distribution**: New tokens created during expansion are distributed to network participants based on governance-defined parameters.

## Governance

Denari operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO):

- **On-Chain Voting**: Token holders can participate in governance by voting on proposals.
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Community governance can modify system parameters like oracle trust thresholds and index composition.
- **Treasury Management**: A portion of seigniorage is directed to a treasury managed by governance.

## Technology Stack

Denari is built on modern blockchain technology:

- **Substrate Framework**: Provides a flexible, upgradeable blockchain architecture.
- **Pallets**: Modular components that implement specific functionality like the inflation index, token adjustments, and governance.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Designed to interact with other blockchains and DeFi ecosystems.

## Consensus Mechanism

Denari uses a hybrid consensus system:

- **Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)**: Secures the network through validator nodes selected by token holders.
- **Security**: The system is designed to remain secure even if up to one-third of validators are malicious.
- **Validator Economics**: Validators are incentivized through inflationary rewards and transaction fees.

## Use Cases

Denari enables several powerful use cases:

- **Store of Value**: Preserves purchasing power over time.
- **Inflation-Protected Savings**: Digital alternative to inflation-indexed bonds.
- **Stable Medium of Exchange**: Suitable for day-to-day transactions and commerce.
- **DeFi Foundation**: Serves as a building block for decentralized finance applications that need inflation protection.
